- 🔭 I’m currently writing some amateur [open source projects](https://github.com/Charmve?tab=repositories), at [@Maiwei.ai](https://github.com/MaiweiAI) and [@UFund](https://github.com/UFund-Me/) by myself. A closed-loop online studying open-source repo is public at [<i><b>@computer-vision-in-action</b></i>](https://github.com/Charmve/computer-vision-in-action) <a href="https://charmve.github.io/computer-vision-in-action"><sup><i><b>Hot</b></i></sup></a>, and more interesting project can be found at [My GitHub repos](https://github.com/Charmve?tab=repositories).
- 🌱 I’m currently working at Momenta.ai, an <b>autonomous driving</b> company. Before that, I was employed at Future Security Labs of Qihoo 360 as a Research SDE. My research interests lie at <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Computer Vision</b>. ([#2](https://github.com/Charmve/Charmve/issues/2))
- 🤔 Only two things make me moved. 
  1. To build a cross-platform [<i>VTuber</i>](https://github.com/DeepVTuber) in meta world, which called [未麻 MIMA](https://github.com/DeepVTuber/MIMA). 
  2. <i>Bring Autonomous Driving into Real Life</i>. To solve the long tail problem and to optimize mass production performance is the goal.
- ❤️ I like eating 🍉, raising 🐓, playing 🏓, sleeping in 🛌 and 📺 [ACGN](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)>).
